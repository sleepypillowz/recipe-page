## Overview

This is my 2nd project in FrontEnd Mentor using HTML & Tailwind.

## My process

  1. I created the skeleton html
  2. I added the contents of the page
  3. I referred to the style-guide.md
  4. I styled the contents of the page one by one
  4. I organized the code using @layer base and components

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- The process of creating a pseudo table using flex

- The application of @layer in tailwind to style specific html tags

### Continued development

There are certain bugs that I'd like to fix in the future
  - none for now, do message me if you spot a bug

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me refer to unfamiliar concepts and resources I may be able to use.
